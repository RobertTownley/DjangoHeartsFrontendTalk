        <p>Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Let your imagination be your guide. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.</p>

        <p>The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Don't fight it, use what happens. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics.</p>

        <p>You can do it. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.</p>

        <p>Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die.</p>

        <p>Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.</p>

        <p>All kinds of happy little splashes. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
