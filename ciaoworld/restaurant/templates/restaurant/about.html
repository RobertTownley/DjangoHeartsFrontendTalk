<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Let's have a happy little tree in here. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Working it up and down, back and forth.</p>

<p>The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Don't fight it, use what happens. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics.</p>

<p>You can do it. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.</p>

<p>Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Let your imagination be your guide. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.</p>

<p>Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.</p>

<p>I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. And just raise cain. Use what you see, don't plan it. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.</p>

<p>All kinds of happy little splashes. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
