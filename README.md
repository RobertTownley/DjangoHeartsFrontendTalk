## Introduction
This is the starting point for our basic web application. It contains a Django project with a fairly standard structure.

## Installation
First, make a new project directory and create a virtual environment
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/ciaoworld
python3 -m venv venv
```
Next, pull down this project from GitHub
```bash
git clone 
```

## Requirements
To follow along, I'd recommend that you have moderate familiarity with Django projects.

## Structure
This repository contains several branches marked "Level 1", "Level 2", etc. Level 0 starts with a basic Django
application: the website for an Italian restaurant, __Ciao World__. Other levels begin to add new features and utilities
to the application.
Level-1: Adding NPM for static asset dependency management
Level-2: Adding BrowserSync for iterative development 
Level-3: Adding SCSS for CSS transpiling
Level-4: Adding webpack for build process management
Level-5: Adding a Vue component
Level-6: Rebuilding the website frontend with React
